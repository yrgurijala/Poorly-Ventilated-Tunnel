# Poorly-Ventilated-Tunnel

A car tunnel is so poorly ventilated that it has become necessary to restrict: 
  1. The number of northbound cars in the tunnel
  2. The number of southbound cars in the tunnel
  3. The total number of cars in the tunnel. 
  
This is accomplished using pthreads, pthread mutexes and pthread condition variables.
